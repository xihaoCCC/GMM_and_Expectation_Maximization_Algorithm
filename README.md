# Clustering Data with Gaussian Mixture Models via Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

## Summary
In this project, I started by generating three-dimensional synthetic data across three clusters, each following to a specified multivariate normal distribution. Then I 
fitted three Guassian Mixture Models (GMM) using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with 5, 12, 30 iterations. Lastly, I visualized and compared the clusters formed by each GMM iteration.


## Setup
This project is developed using Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook. Refer to `GMM_EM.ipynb` for the required packages. Please
make sure your -`threadpoolctl` package has a version > 3.0.0, otherwise model fitting will fail.


## File Descriptions
- `GMM_EM.ipynb`: Python notebook responsible for data generation and model construction.
- `GMM_EM.pdf`: PDF export of the `GMM_EM.ipynb` notebook.


## Content
This project includes 3 parts in total, specifically: 
1. Synthesize three-dimensional synthetic data following to specified multivariate normal distributions
2. Fit three Guassian Mixture Models (GMM) using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
3. Visualize the results
